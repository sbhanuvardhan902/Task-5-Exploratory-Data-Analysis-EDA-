# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer demographic and sales transaction details, including:
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Income**
- **Product categories**
- **Purchase amounts**

## Missing Value Handling
- **Numerical columns:** Filled missing values with median values.
- **Categorical columns:** Filled missing values with mode values.

## EDA Process
- Inspected the data structure using `.info()` and `.describe()` methods.
- Visualized feature distributions using histograms and boxplots.
- Detected and analyzed outliers in numeric data.
- Analyzed relationships between features using pairplots and correlation heatmaps.

## Key Insights
- **Age** and **income** significantly influence purchase behavior.
- Certain **product categories** dominate the sales volume.
- Some features exhibit strong inter-relationships, useful for modeling.

## Conclusion
- The dataset was cleaned and prepared without any row loss.
- It is now ready for further predictive modeling and business analysis.
